# cub3d

This will be the first time you will be rendering something in 3D. For a lot of
people this is hard to grasp, and that is completely fine. There are a number
of documentations available to learn how to raycast. The ones we used
are from 'lodev':

- [RayCasting part 1](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)
- [RayCasting part 2](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting2.html)
- [RayCasting part 3](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting3.html)
- [RayCasting part 4](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting4.html)

These will provide you with a very good explanation on how raycasting works and
how to implement it into your program. For MiniLibX you may use [our documentation](../libs/minilibx).
