For me, one of the most time consuming things is trying to find out how to god
damn 42 libraries work. They often come with little to no documentation and most
of the time only have a baguette version. This makes it a very time consuming
process before you can actually start using the project. Therefore I am making
this pity attempt at trying to change that culture.

Whilst I am traversing the curriculum, I will document any libraries or projects
that I find worth mentioning. These I will all add to this github page. This way
no one will have to suffer like how I did.

If you find anything that you think other people can benefit from in terms of
documentation, feel free to hit me up with a pull request. In the end, it is a
peer to peer learning system, which means that this process must be mutual
in its most purest form.

P.S. feel free to give me a star ;)
